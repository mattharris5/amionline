# Am I Online?
A simple, one-page app to check if the internet is working. Displays a random "positive" emoji so that no additional network requests need to load images. Plus a handy way to get your current IP on a nice, clean page.

Currently deployed at [amionline.xyz](http://amionline.xyz). Have fun!
